Yii-Commerce is an ecommerce solution based on the Yii Framework with the osCommerce 2.2 database schema.

So far, there's not a lot here, but a team exists and we're going to build this into something lightweight and extensible, not competing with Magento, but rather an MVC version of osCommerce.

Using the osCommerce database means that "contributions" for osCommerce are then easily ported, and it's actually a nice neat db for an ecommerce app.

Feel free to join in, either by adding issues/feature requests, designing us a logo, or just sending us feedback.
